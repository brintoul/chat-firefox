I am proud to announce the creation of a new [ChatGPT extension for Firefox]. This extension allows you to easily save all your important questions and ideas from your ChatGPT interactions right on your computer. No more copying and pasting or trying to remember what you discussed with ChatGPT. With this handy tool, you can store all your important ideas and access them later.

Simply chat with ChatGPT on [https://chat.openai.com/chat], click "Download ChatGPT" after the chat, and open the saved page in your browser. The extension removes any extra styles, making it easy to read and understand your saved conversations. And best of all, you don't have to identify yourselfâ€Š-â€Šthe extension is completely anonymous.

The Chrome version of my ChatGPT extension is ready. However, I require a Google developer account to bring it to the market. I am seeking financial support. Show your support by purchasing my [unique NFT].
